### Education 
I'm a second year at UC San Diego majoring in:

1. Computer Science
2. Cognitive Science-Machine Learning and Neural Computation
3.  Mathematics-Applied Science

Learning/education are *quite* important to me, and, fittingly, I agree with the famous quote:

> Knowledge itself is power 
> /- Francis Bacon
